touch log_analyzer.sh
This creates a new empty file named log_analyzer.sh where I wrote the shell script.

chmod +x log_analyzer.sh
This makes the log_analyzer.sh script executable.

nano log_analyzer.sh
This opens the script file in a text editor where I wrote the code.

touch log.txt
This creates a log file used as input for the script.

nano log.txt
This opens the log file where sample log entries were added.

./log_analyzer.sh log.txt
I ran the script with a valid log file. The script counted total entries, INFO, WARNING, and ERROR messages, and displayed the most recent ERROR.

./log_analyzer.sh
I ran the script without providing a log file. The script displayed an error because exactly one argument is required.

./log_analyzer.sh fake.txt
I ran the script with a non-existing file. The script displayed an error indicating the file does not exist.
