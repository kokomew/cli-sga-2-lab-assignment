touch process_text.sh
This creates a new shell script file named process_text.sh.

chmod +x process_text.sh
This makes the script executable so it can be run from the terminal.

nano process_text.sh
This opens the script file in the editor to write the shell script code.

touch data.txt
This creates a text file that will be used as input for the script.

nano data.txt
This opens the text file and sample text was added for analysis.

./process_text.sh data.txt
I ran the script with a valid file. The script displayed the number of lines, words, and characters in the file.

./process_text.sh
I ran the script without any argument. The script showed an error message because one argument is required.

./process_text.sh fake.txt
I ran the script with a file that does not exist. The script displayed an appropriate error message.
