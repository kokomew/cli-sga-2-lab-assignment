mkdir dirA dirB
This creates two directories, dirA and dirB, to hold sample files for comparison.

echo "hello world" > dirA/file1.txt
echo "same content" > dirA/file2.txt
echo "same content" > dirB/file2.txt
echo "only in B" > dirB/file3.txt
These commands create sample text files in dirA and dirB. Some files are unique to each directory and some are common with the same content.

touch sync.sh
This creates an empty shell script file for comparing directories.

chmod +x sync.sh
This makes the script executable.

nano sync.sh
This opens the script file where the directory comparison logic is written.

./sync.sh dirA dirB
This runs the script on the two directories. It shows files only in dirA, files only in dirB, and checks whether common files have matching content.

./sync.sh dirA
This runs the script with only one argument. It shows an error because the script requires exactly two directories.

cp sync.sh /mnt/c/Users/mehvi/Documents/
This copies the script to the Windows Documents folder so it can be uploaded to GitHub.
