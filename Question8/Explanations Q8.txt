mkdir test_dir
Created a new directory named test_dir where I will put some test files.

touch test_dir/file1.txt
touch test_dir/file2.txt
touch test_dir/file3.txt
Created three empty text files inside test_dir to test moving files.

touch bg_move.sh
Created a new file for the shell script.

chmod +x bg_move.sh
Made the script executable so I can run it.

nano bg_move.sh
Opened the script in a text editor to write the code for moving files into backup.

./bg_move.sh test_dir
Ran the script with test_dir as input. It moved each file into a backup/ subdirectory in the background and displayed the PID of each background process. After all moves finished, it confirmed completion.

ls test_dir/backup
Checked the backup/ folder to confirm all files were moved successfully.

./bg_move.sh
Ran the script without an argument. Script showed an error because it requires exactly one directory.

./bg_move.sh fake_dir
Ran the script with a non-existing directory. Script showed an error because the directory does not exist.

cp bg_move.sh /mnt/c/Users/mehvi/Documents/
Copied the script to the Documents folder in Windows to prepare for GitHub upload.

cp test_dir /mnt/c/Users/mehvi/Documents/   # use -r if you want to copy directory
Copied the test_dir directory and its contents to Windows. The -r option is needed because it’s a folder.
