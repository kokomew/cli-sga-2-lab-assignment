touch analyze.sh
This creates a new empty file named analyze.sh where I will write the shell script.

chmod +x analyze.sh
This makes the analyze.sh script executable so I can run it.

nano analyze.sh
This opens the file in a text editor where I wrote the shell script code.

./analyze.sh user_info.txt
I ran the script with a file as input. The script displayed the number of lines, words, and characters in the file.

./analyze.sh ~/project_documents
I ran the script with a directory as input. The script counted all files and the number of .txt files inside the directory.

./analyze.sh
I ran the script without any argument. The script showed an error because it needs exactly one argument.

./analyze.sh fake.txt
I ran the script with a non-existing path. The script showed an error indicating the path does not exist.
