touch zombie_demo.c
This creates an empty C file named zombie_demo.c where I wrote the code to demonstrate zombie processes.

nano zombie_demo.c
This opens the file in a text editor where I wrote the C code.

gcc zombie_demo.c -o zombie_demo
This compiles the C code into an executable named zombie_demo using GCC.

./zombie_demo
I ran the compiled program. It created two child processes. The program then cleaned up the child processes, ensuring no zombies remained.

./zombie_demo fake_input
I ran the program with an extra argument (even though it doesn’t need it). The program still executed correctly, created two child processes, and cleaned them up without leaving zombies.
