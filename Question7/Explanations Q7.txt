nano words.txt
I edited the file to include words like AI, IOU, sky, fly, cat, dog, apple, orange, art for testing the script.

chmod +x patterns.sh
Made the patterns.sh script executable.

./patterns.sh words.txt
Ran the script with the input file. It created vowels.txt, consonants.txt, and mixed.txt based on word patterns.

cat vowels.txt
Checked the vowels.txt file. It contains words with only vowels: AI, IOU.

cat consonants.txt
Checked the consonants.txt file. It contains words with only consonants: sky, fly, cat, dog.

cat mixed.txt
Checked the mixed.txt file. It contains words that start with a consonant and have vowels: apple, orange, art.

./patterns.sh
Ran the script without any arguments. It showed an error asking for exactly one input file.

./patterns.sh fake.txt
Ran the script with a non-existing file. It showed an error indicating the file does not exist.

cp patterns.sh words.txt vowels.txt consonants.txt mixed.txt /mnt/c/Users/mehvi/Documents/
Copied the script and all output files to the Windows Documents folder to upload to GitHub.
