touch input.txt
This creates a new file input.txt where I wrote some sample text to test the script.

nano input.txt
This opens input.txt so I can add sample words for analysis.

touch metrics.sh
This creates an empty shell script file to write the metrics analysis code.

chmod +x metrics.sh
This makes the metrics.sh script executable.

nano metrics.sh
This opens the script file where I wrote the logic to find longest, shortest, average word length, and total unique words.

./metrics.sh input.txt
I ran the script with a valid file. The script calculated the longest word, shortest word, average word length, and number of unique words.

./metrics.sh
I ran the script without an argument. The script showed an error because it needs exactly one input file.

./metrics.sh fake.txt
I ran the script with a non-existing file. The script showed an error indicating the file does not exist.

cp metrics.sh input.txt /mnt/c/Users/mehvi/Documents/
This copies both the script and the input file to the Windows Documents folder so they can be uploaded to GitHub.
